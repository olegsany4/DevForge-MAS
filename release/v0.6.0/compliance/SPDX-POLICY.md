# SPDX Header Policy

All source files SHOULD include an SPDX license identifier in the first 10 lines:
Example:
  SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0

For third-party vendored code, preserve original headers and license texts.
For mixed-license trees, prefer permissive licenses (Apache-2.0/MIT/BSD).
Changing a file's license requires ADR approval and legal review.
